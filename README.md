  Ex: -m person
-f - is model field set.
  Ex: -f "name, height(number), gender|male, color"

* When you are using fields, you have to comma seperate the fields names.
* The default feild type will be string. But you can simply add the data type using parentheses "()"
* For any default value just use pipe "|" character
* Both data type and default can be combined, but make sure to use default after the data type. Ex: height(number)|25
